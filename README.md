### Roadmap
You can find the roadmap for the Open Live Writer product [here](https://github.com/OpenLiveWriter/OpenLiveWriter/blob/master/roadmap.md).

For the website, we are initially focussed on getting a fast, lightweight product homepage set up. Then we want to increase the end
user help content to assist people using Open Live Writer. [Developer documentation should live alongside the code](https://github.com/OpenLiveWriter/OpenLiveWriter/).
