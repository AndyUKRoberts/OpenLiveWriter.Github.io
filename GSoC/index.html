<ul>
    <li>Portable version
        <p>This would involve a fork of OpenLiveWriter so that it could run on 
            a thumbdrive or similar device, allowing the user to use someone else's 
            computer without modifying it.  See <a href=http://portableapps.com> http://portableapps.com/</a></p>
