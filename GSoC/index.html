<h3>Project Ideas</h3>
<p>These are all popularly requested features.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Portable version
        <p>This would involve a fork of OpenLiveWriter so that it could run on 
            a thumbdrive or similar device, allowing the user to use someone else's 
            computer without modifying it.  See <a href=http://portableapps.com> http://portableapps.com/</a></p> 
    </li>
<li>Github Markdown support
    <p>Currently OpenLiveWriter only supports HTML.  We would like to support markdown also</p>
</li>
<li>YouTube Video (and other providers) includes
    <p>A former feature of Live Writer, we need to add support of videos.  There are several YouTube videos showing this support</p>
</li>
<li>Allowing other languages to be used (culturalization)
    <p>Another former feature, requested frequently</p>
</li>   
</ul>
